**About Me**

- I, Huo Zongwei, am an undergraduate student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), one of China's prestigious universities with a rich history and strong academic reputation.
- My research interests lie in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Reinforcement Learning. I am particularly fascinated by the potential of these technologies to revolutionize various industries and solve complex problems.

**Projects**

- One of my notable projects is **CppTensor**, which is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/Hzwx158/CppTensor](https://github.com/Hzwx158/CppTensor). This project focuses on developing efficient tensor operations and computations in C++, which are fundamental for many AI and machine learning applications.
